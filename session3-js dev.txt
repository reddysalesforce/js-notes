innerText -- inserts text
innerHTML -- inserts HTML

document.querySelector("#hello").style.display = "none"

exam view: display:none is used for filtering lists
if visiblity:hidden is used then blank space will be there

//display - none,block
//visiblity - visible, hidden

Event listener
1. addEventListener() - register an event handler
2. removeEventListener() - remove an event hanlder
NOTE: when these two event listeners are used  "on" is not used

"on" attribute is used with Event handler attribute and Event handler property


***************page load events**************
NOTE: questions will be from this
LoadEvents:
-------------
1. DOMContentLoaded - dom tree loaded or not is checked
2. load - fully loaded HTML and also external resources like images and stylesheets

Unload events:
-------------
beforeunload: fires before  page and resources are unloaded
unload: fires when the page has completely unloaded

************Event Flows***************
event flow - explains the order in which events are received on the page from the element
where the event occurs and propagated through the DOM tree
There are two main event models:
1. Event Bubbling - event flows up from specific element and to last parent
2. Event capturing-event starts at the least specific element and flows downward toward the most specific element

********custom events***********
NOTE:
Inside custom event there is a property called "detail"
and for custom event second argument is object
where we pass data

ex:
<body id="body">
	<button id="btn">click me</button>
	<div id="msg"></div>
	<script>
	//custom events
	//1 create an event
	let btn = document.querySelector("#btn")
	let msg = document/querySelector("#msg")
	btn.addEventListener("click", function(e){
		//creation
		let helloEvent = new CustomEvent("showmsg",{
			detail: "hello msg"
		})
		//trigger
		btn.dispatchEvent(helloEvent)
	})
	
	btn.addEventListener("showmsg", function(e){
		console.log(e.detail)
		msg.innerText = e.detail
	})
	</script>
</body>

o/p: 
hello msg in printed in console
hello msg is added in page
-----------------------------
currentTarget: where listener is attached
target : where event is triggered

*************Browser object model***************
default object is window
window API

alert
confirm
prompt
setTimeout
setInterval
localStorage
sessionstorage
-----------------------------------
**********localStorage**************
NOTE: localstorage saves the data in string format
//1. saving data to localStorage
localStorage.setItem("code","12345")
//2. reading data from localStorage
var code = localStorage.getItem("code")
//3. Removing data from localStorage
localStorage.removeItem("code")
--------------------------
**************sessionstorage***************
sessionstorage is alive until session is alive
//1. saving data to localStorage
sessionStorage.setItem("code","12345")
//2. reading data from localStorage
var code = sessionStorage.getItem("code")
//3. Removing data from sessionStorage
sessionStorage.removeItem("code")
NOTE:
The sessionStorage object stores data for only one session
(the data is deleted when the browser tab is closed)
----------------------------------
 location API 
 Navigator API
 Screen API: It provides the attributes of the screen on which the current window is being rendered
 History API:
